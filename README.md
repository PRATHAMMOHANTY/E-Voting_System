# E-Voting_System
The main objective of developing this “E voting system” is "ONLINE  VOTING" to conduct voting which is more secure and  rapid so that every voter casting a vote in an online or voting booth for a candidate  is uniquely authenticated and check out the results after elections were  completed.
